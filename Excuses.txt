My QWERTY is quirky.
My muse has stepped out for coffee.
The characters have taken over the plot.
My plot points have turned to mush.
My muse is a fat bastard.
How to word.
My setting has caught on fire.
I worldbuilt myself into a corner.
My muse overslept.
The plot train jumped the track.
I got sucked into a research black hole.
Can't sleep. Plot bunnies will eat me.
The dog ate my outline.
