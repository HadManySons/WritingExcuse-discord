My QWERTY is quirky.
My muse has stepped out for coffee.
The characters have taken over the plot.
My plot points have turned to mush.
My muse is a fat bastard.
How to word.
My setting has caught on fire.
I worldbuilt myself into a corner.
My muse overslept.
The plot train jumped the track.
I got sucked into a research black hole.
Can't sleep. Plot bunnies will eat me.
The dog ate my outline.
Can't write now, must mow the dickgrass.
I have to return some videotapes.
Brain no worky.
I'm watching a fight on Twitter.
I'm attending the opening of my garage door.
My uncle got out again, brb.
Dog ate my muse.
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
I have to hide the bodies.
My pet rock died, the funeral is today.
My spirit animal has guided me away from the computer today.
Busy advising on which book to push big this Christmas.
